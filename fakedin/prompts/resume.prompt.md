I need you to generate a realistic, professional résumé for a fictional person with the following details:

Full Name: {full_name}
Age: {age}
Email: {email}
Phone: {phone_number}
City: {city}
State: {state}
Full Location: {location}
Career Field: {career_field}
Experience Level: {experience_level} ({experience_years} years of experience)

Please create a detailed, realistic résumé that includes:

1. Contact information (use the provided name, email, and phone)
2. Professional summary that references their location ({city}, {state})
3. Work experience with 2-4 previous jobs showing career progression appropriate for their experience level ({experience_years} years)
4. Education (appropriate for the career field and age of {age})
5. Skills (technical and soft skills relevant to {career_field})
6. Optional sections as appropriate (certifications, volunteer work, etc. that would be suitable for someone at the {experience_level} level)

Make sure the résumé is realistic with specific, concrete details that demonstrate actual accomplishments and skills. Avoid generic job descriptions. Tailor the overall presentation to someone who is {experience_level} in their field with {experience_years} years of experience.

Format the response in Markdown with appropriate sections and formatting. Do not surround it with triple-ticks (```), just raw Markdown.

Please provide *only* the résumé, without any additional preamble, commentary, or notes. Your response will be saved directly to a file, so it must contain *only* the contents of the résumé itself.
