I need you to generate a realistic, professional resume for a fictional person with the following details:

Name: {{ full_name }}
Age: {{ age }}
Location: {{ location }}
Career Field: {{ career_field }}
Experience Level: {{ experience_level }} ({{ experience_years }} years of experience)

Please create a detailed, realistic resume that includes:

1. Contact information (use a fake phone number and email address)
2. Professional summary
3. Work experience with 2-4 previous jobs showing career progression appropriate for their experience level
4. Education (appropriate for the career field)
5. Skills (technical and soft skills relevant to their field)
6. Optional sections as appropriate (certifications, volunteer work, etc.)

Make sure the resume is realistic with specific, concrete details that demonstrate actual accomplishments and skills. Avoid generic job descriptions.

Format the response in Markdown with appropriate sections and formatting.
