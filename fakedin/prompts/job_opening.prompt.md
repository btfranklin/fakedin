**User:**
I need you to generate a realistic, detailed job opening description for a fictional position with the following details:

Company Name: {company_name}
Career Field: {career_field}
Experience Level Required: {experience_level}
Work Model: {work_model} (Remote/Hybrid/On-Site)
Salary Range: {salary_range}
Minimum Salary: {min_salary}
Maximum Salary: {max_salary}

Please create a comprehensive job posting that includes:

1. A compelling job title appropriate for the {career_field} field at the {experience_level} level
2. Company overview (create a realistic company description for {company_name})
3. Job description with specific responsibilities appropriate for someone in {career_field}
4. Required qualifications that match the {experience_level} level
5. Preferred qualifications that would be ideal for this role
6. Benefits and perks, including the {work_model} work arrangement and competitive salary range of {salary_range}
7. Application process

Make the job description specific and detailed, not generic. Include actual technologies, tools, or methodologies relevant to the {career_field}. The salary expectations should align with the specified range (minimum {min_salary} to maximum {max_salary}). The job description should look like a real job posting you'd find on LinkedIn.

Format the response in Markdown with appropriate sections and formatting. Do not surround it with triple-ticks (```), just raw Markdown.

Please provide *only* the job posting, without any additional preamble or commentary. Your response will be saved directly to a file.
