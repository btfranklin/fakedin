I need you to generate a realistic, detailed job opening description for a fictional position with the following details:

Company Name: {{ company_name }}
Career Field: {{ career_field }}
Experience Level Required: {{ experience_level }}
Work Model: {{ work_model }} (Remote/Hybrid/On-Site)
Salary Range: {{ salary_range }}

Please create a comprehensive job posting that includes:

1. A compelling job title appropriate for the experience level and field
2. Company overview (create a realistic company description)
3. Job description with specific responsibilities
4. Required qualifications and experience
5. Preferred qualifications
6. Benefits and perks
7. Application process

Make the job description specific and detailed, not generic. Include actual technologies, tools, or methodologies relevant to the field. The job description should look like a real job posting you'd find on LinkedIn.

Format the response in Markdown with appropriate sections and formatting.

**Assistant:**
